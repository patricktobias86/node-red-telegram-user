# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-29
### Added
- Added peer-aware `resolve-peer`, `edit-message`, `forward-messages`, and `download-media` nodes.
- Added shared MTProto peer-resolution helpers that rely on Telegram entities and session-cached access hashes.

### Changed
- Store API hashes and session strings using Node-RED credential storage while retaining legacy-flow loading compatibility.
- Preserve explicit false values in send-message options.

### Fixed
- Preserve the Telegram response when send-message succeeds through its input-entity fallback.
- Avoid failing when send-message has no file configured.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-08-29
### Changed
- Migrated all Node-RED editor registrations to the Node-RED DXP `createEditorNode` helper.
- Replaced manual editor selectors and event wiring with bundled Node-RED DXP DOM helpers where applicable.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-08-29
### Changed
- Added `@keload/node-red-dxp` and migrated delete-message error handling to its `tryit` utility.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-04-17
### Fixed
- Security Fixes

## [1.2.4] - 2026-03-07
### Fixed
- Security Fixes

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-07
### Added
- Added guarded checks before the Telegram client is called to avoid errors when the client is not available.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-22
### Added
- Receiver node option to disable emitting edited message updates (useful to prevent duplicate outputs when counters/markup change on channel posts).

## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-31
### Fixed
- Receiver node chat/sender filters now work (include/exclude chats and senders).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-12
### Changed
- Switched underlying Telegram MTProto client dependency from `telegram` (GramJS) to `teleproto`.

## [1.1.22] - 2026-01-12
### Fixed
- Receiver node now handles additional MTProto update types that were being silently dropped:
  - `UpdateNewScheduledMessage` - Scheduled messages
  - `UpdateDeleteScheduledMessages` - Deleted scheduled messages
  - `UpdateBotNewBusinessMessage` - Telegram Business account messages
  - `UpdateBotEditBusinessMessage` - Edited business messages
  - `UpdateBotDeleteBusinessMessage` - Deleted business messages
  - `UpdateQuickReplyMessage` - Quick reply messages
  - `UpdateReadStories` - Story read updates

## [1.1.21] - 2026-01-06
### Fixed
- Receiver node now correctly handles messages from channels when the sender is an anonymous admin, ensuring such messages are processed and not dropped.

## [1.1.20] - 2026-01-05
### Added
- Receiver node now emits debug events on a second output when Debug is enabled, so you can see internal logs in the Node-RED debug sidebar.
### Fixed
- Receiver node now also supports GramJS `Integer { value: ... }` wrappers when deriving `payload.chatId` / `payload.senderId`.
- Receiver node now populates `payload.chatId` / `payload.senderId` when Telegram IDs arrive as numeric strings (common in debug/output), so downstream filters work reliably.
- Receiver node now listens to Raw MTProto updates and derives sender/chat identity safely so valid messages (channel posts, anonymous admins, service messages, missing fromId) are no longer dropped.

## [1.1.16] - 2025-09-22
### Added
- Receiver node option to ignore configurable message types (such as videos or documents) to prevent oversized uploads.
### Changed
- Receiver node collects detailed media type metadata to power the new filter while keeping debug logging informative.

## [1.1.15] - 2025-09-21
### Added
- Receiver node option to drop updates when media exceeds a configurable size threshold, preventing large downloads.

## [1.1.7] - 2025-07-22
### Added
- Mocha tests for the configuration node ensure sessions are reused correctly.

### Changed
- Session management now tracks active clients in a `Map` for safer reuse.

## [1.1.8] - 2025-07-22
### Fixed
- Receiver and Command nodes now remove their event listeners when closed to prevent duplicate messages after redeploys.

## [1.1.10] - 2025-07-27
### Fixed
- Receiver node no longer fails when Debug is enabled and handles updates containing `BigInt` values.
### Changed
- `delete-message` now forwards the original message along with the Telegram API response.

## [1.1.11] - 2025-08-04
### Fixed
- All nodes now preserve properties on the incoming message outside of the payload.

## [1.1.12] - 2025-08-06
### Fixed
- Auth node now emits the generated `stringSession` so it can be used by other nodes.
